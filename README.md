## Description

## Installation 
If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project and you have an internet connection.

## Usage 
The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML, CSS, and javascript. It could be used to check the weather.

## Credits 
I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. In addition, several portions of code were created based on in class activities. I have included citations in the form of comments throughout the html and javascript.

## Contributing 
I was the only one to work on this project, but of course I had help from my instructor, TA's, and classmates.

## Challenges
TBA
